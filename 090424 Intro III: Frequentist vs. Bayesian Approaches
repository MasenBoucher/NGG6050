BACKGROUND (Copied from QNC GitHub)

  Let's start with a simple example, taken from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy#Example_1:_HIV

  "Imagine running an HIV test on A SAMPLE of 1000 persons ..."

  "The test has a false positive rate of 5% (0.05)..." i.e., the probability that someone who takes the test gets a POSITIVE result despite the fact that the person does NOT have HIV

  "...and no false negative rate." i.e., The probability that someone who takes the test gets a NEGATIVE result despite the fact that the person DOES have HIV.


Exercise #1: If someone gets a positive test, is it "statistically significant" at the p<0.05 level? Why or why not?

  The case of an HIV test would represent a low prevalence population -- according to the WHO, although there are at least 39.9 million people living with HIV, only 0.6% of the adult world population is HIV+.
  
  If running a sample of 1000 persons, the number of true positive cases would be 6 people --> 1000*(6/1000)=6
  If the test has a false positive rate of 5%, if running a sample of 1000 persons, the number of false positive cases would be about 50 people --> 1000*((1000-6)/1000)*0.05=49.7


Exercise #2: What is the probability that if someone gets a positive test, that person is infected?
