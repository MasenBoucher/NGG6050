BACKGROUND (Copied from QNC GitHub)

  Let's start with a simple example, taken from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy#Example_1:_HIV

  "Imagine running an HIV test on A SAMPLE of 1000 persons ..."

  "The test has a false positive rate of 5% (0.05)..." i.e., the probability that someone who takes the test gets a POSITIVE result despite the fact that the person does NOT have HIV

  "...and no false negative rate." i.e., The probability that someone who takes the test gets a NEGATIVE result despite the fact that the person DOES have HIV.


Exercise #1: If someone gets a positive test, is it "statistically significant" at the p<0.05 level? Why or why not?

  The case of an HIV test would represent a low prevalence population -- according to the WHO, although there are at least 39.9 million people living with HIV, only 0.6% of the adult world population is HIV+.
  
  If running a sample of 1000 persons, the number of true positive cases would be 6 people --> 1000*(6/1000)=6
  If the test has a false positive rate of 5%, if running a sample of 1000 persons, the number of false positive cases would be ~50 people --> 1000*((1000-6)/1000)*0.05=49.7
  Thus, only 6 out of 56 positive tests would be true positives, and 50 out of 56 positive tests would be false positives. 
  So the probability of being a true positive after having tested positive would only be ~10.7%, which is abysmal when considering the "95% accuracy rate." 

  This would not be "statistically significant" at the p<0.05 level -- only ~10.7% of cases that test postive are true positives, thus the meaningful error rate is far above 5% (p=~0.9)
  Additionally, statistics like this try to tell us something at the population level. While they can denote the risk a single value may be "incorrect," they cannot tell us for something for certain about a given value from the population.


Exercise #2: What is the probability that if someone gets a positive test, that person is infected?
  P(Infected|Positive)=((P(Positive|Infected)*P(Infected))/P(Positive)
  P(Positive)=((P(Positive|Infected)*P(Infected))/P(Infected|Positive)
  P(Positive|NotInfected)=0.5
  P(NotInfected)=1-P(Positive|NotInfected)=0.95
  P(Positive)=P(Infected)+0.05*0.95

  Assuming Infection Rate of 0 
  P(Positive)=P(Infected)+0.05*0.95
  P(Positive)=0+0.05*0.95=0.0475
  P(Infected|Positive)=0/0.0475=0

  Assuming Infection Rate of 0.1 
  P(Positive)=P(Infected)+0.05*0.95
  P(Positive)=0.1+0.05*0.95=0.1475
  P(Infected|Positive)=0.1/0.1475=0.6779661

  Assuming Infection Rate of 0.2 
  P(Positive)=P(Infected)+0.05*0.95
  P(Positive)=0.2+0.05*0.95=0.0.2475
  P(Infected|Positive)=0.2/0.2475=0.80808081

  Assuming Infection Rate of 0.3
  P(Positive)=P(Infected)+0.05*0.95
  P(Positive)=0.3+0.05*0.95=0.0.3475
  P(Infected|Positive)=0.3/0.3475=0.86330935

  Assuming Infection Rate of 0.4
  P(Positive)=P(Infected)+0.05*0.95
  P(Positive)=0.4+0.05*0.95=0.0.4475
  P(Infected|Positive)=0.4/0.4475=0.89385475

  Assuming Infection Rate of 0.5 
  P(Positive)=P(Infected)+0.05*0.95
  P(Positive)=0.5+0.05*0.95=0.0.5475
  P(Infected|Positive)=0.5/0.5475=0.91324201

  Assuming Infection Rate of 0.6 
  P(Positive)=P(Infected)+0.05*0.95
  P(Positive)=0.6+0.05*0.95=0.0.6475
  P(Infected|Positive)=0.6/0.6475=0.92664093

  Assuming Infection Rate of 0.7 

  Assuming Infection Rate of 0.8

  Assuming Infection Rate of 0.9

  Assuming Infection Rate of 1.0

  Although it was obvious with Exercise #1 that the probability of a positive test translating to an actual infection is affected by the base rate of actual infection. Comparing...
