BACKGROUND (Copied from QNC GitHub)

  Let's start with a simple example, taken from:

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy#Example_1:_HIV

  "Imagine running an HIV test on A SAMPLE of 1000 persons ..."

  "The test has a false positive rate of 5% (0.05)..." i.e., the probability that someone who takes the test gets a POSITIVE result despite the fact that the person does NOT have HIV

  "...and no false negative rate." i.e., The probability that someone who takes the test gets a NEGATIVE result despite the fact that the person DOES have HIV.


Exercise #1: If someone gets a positive test, is it "statistically significant" at the p<0.05 level? Why or why not?





Exercise #2: What is the probability that if someone gets a positive test, that person is infected?
